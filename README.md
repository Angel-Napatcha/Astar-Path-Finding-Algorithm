# Astar-Path-Finding-Algorithm
Implemented and visualised the A* search algorithm using Python based on the formula f = g + h, such that f is the total cost of the node, g is the distance between the current node and the start node, h is the heuristic, or the estimated distance from the current node to the end node, which is estimated by using the formula ((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)^1/2.
